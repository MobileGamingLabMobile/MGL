The product is an application to build up small GPS based games and publish them to the community. Everyone in the community can subscribe the game and afterwards is able to play the game on his/her mobile terminal. The Application is based on web technologies and is divided in two parts. The first part contains the server side which is hosting the building-complex you can access via internet browser of your choice (Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer,...) and also the game-engine doing all the calculations. Secondly there is the mobile terminal containing the access to the community and actually running the game.

The intention is that with the application games of the genre role-playing game (RPG) and adventure game can be created as well as paper chases and games like “zombie run”. The application is constructed in this way that new elements of an existing abstract game element can be implemented easily by a developer. So it is possible that complex games can be created. Moreover community aspects are considered. The platform offers that the created games can be played by other players, not only the creator of the game. Also users can communicate with other users above the platform. The data model of the game engine is furthermore structured that way that multiple players can play against each other or together.
